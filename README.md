# azure-customvision-sample

This project uses the Custom Vision Service in Java. This Java application shows how to create a training project, add classification tags, upload your images, train the project, obtain the project's default prediction endpoint URL, and use the endpoint to programmatically test an image. Use this open-source example as a template for building your own app for Windows by using the Custom Vision Service API.


# Steps to run application
- Git project
- Replace the training key and prediction key in the code w/ your keys (https://customvision.ai)
- Create 2 folders w/ your images (note: this example only uses 2 image paths.  You can use more than 2 in your case)
